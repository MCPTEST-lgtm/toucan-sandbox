# GHSA-2025-001: Log4j Remote Code Execution Risk

Summary: A critical RCE risk associated with vulnerable Log4j versions can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted inputs that trigger JNDI lookups.

Assessment for this repository (MCPTEST-lgtm/toucan-sandbox): There is no runtime usage of Log4j in this repo. Any references, if present, are limited to build-time or dev tooling and do not ship or execute in production runtime.

Action: Documented the risk and ensured visibility. No runtime exposure identified.

Next steps: A scheduled weekly dependency re-check workflow has been added to monitor for any dependency graph changes or transient introductions.

Mitigation note: If Log4j is ever introduced at runtime, ensure patched versions are used and disable vulnerable lookups (e.g., JndiLookup removal) per official guidance.
