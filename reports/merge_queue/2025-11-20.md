Policy: failing CI first, then oldest updated. CI status and requested reviewers were not available via API in this run; ranks fall back to Last Updated time when CI status is unknown.

Notes:
- CI statuses and requested reviewers could not be retrieved via the available API in this environment; treat all as Unknown/None for this snapshot.
- Priority ranks therefore default to ordering by Last Updated (oldest first) since no CI failures were detected.

Top risks (for leadership skim):
- High: #35 HOTFIX_RELEASE critical config change; #37 DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKER; #34 SECURITY dependency bump; #38 HOTFIX security guidance. These potentially impact release velocity and security posture.
- Medium: #40 deployment blocker documentation (traceability), should not block release once code fixes (#37) are green.
- Lower: #14, #17, #36, #39, #41 are docs and policy updates; merge when reviewers have bandwidth.

Suggested reviewer assignments:
- Release engineering: review #35 and #37 immediately (hotfix + deploy workflow). Target: 1 code owner + 1 CI maintainer.
- Security: review #34 and #38 (security fix and guidance). Target: security champion + one maintainer.
- Docs: review #14, #17, #36, #39, #41. Target: docs maintainer; add a French-speaking reviewer for localization PRs (#36, #41).

Follow-ups for automation:
- Enhance the triage job to fetch latest CI status per head SHA and requested_reviewers to fully honor the “failing CI first” rubric.
