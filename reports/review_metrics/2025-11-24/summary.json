  "notes": "One outlier PR (backend migration) took ~96 hours to receive the first review and ~168 hours to merge, skewing the mean; excluding it brings avg_time_to_first_review_hours to 4.2 and median_time_to_merge_hours to 26.0. Distribution suggests light imbalance (alice handling ~44% of reviews). Consider load-balancing during on-call rotations."
