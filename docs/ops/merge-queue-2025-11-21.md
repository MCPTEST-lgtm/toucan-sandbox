Time window: PRs updated in the last 24 hours.

Priority scoring notes:
- Highest priority: PRs touching /services/billing/* or /infra/terraform/*
- Otherwise: weigh requested reviewers and CI status (failing CI with active reviewers ranks above passing CI with no reviewers)

## Queue Overview

| PR# | Title | Requested reviewers | CI status | Priority |
| --- | ----- | ------------------- | --------- | -------- |

_No qualifying pull requests were updated in the last 24 hours._

## Risk brief (Engineering Ops — New York)
- Risk to tomorrow’s standup is low given the quiet queue; no billing or Terraform changes were observed in the last 24 hours.
- CI signal appears stable with no high-risk sequences identified; continue to monitor early-morning pushes from other time zones.
- Recommendation for the NY team: prepare fast-review capacity for any late-arriving billing/infra updates and pre-assign reviewers to minimize idle queue time.
