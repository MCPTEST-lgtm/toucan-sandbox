# Release audit — 2025-11-21: us-east-1 rollout blocker (/healthz)

## Summary
During the us-east-1 rollout, pods repeatedly failed liveness/readiness due to aggressive probe timing, producing transient timeouts on `/healthz` during warm-up and halting the rollout.

## Remediation
Probe settings were tuned to allow for startup jitter while still detecting genuine failures.

## Config diff
```diff
- initialDelaySeconds: 0
- periodSeconds: 3
- timeoutSeconds: 1
- failureThreshold: 1
+ initialDelaySeconds: 10
+ periodSeconds: 5
+ timeoutSeconds: 2
+ failureThreshold: 3
```
